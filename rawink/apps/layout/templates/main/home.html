					<p>I saw society opening up to tattooing but every tattoo I saw was the same! Probably because its all the same reference (google), so of course there will be similar 'copies'... My goal is to use unique reference and to give one of a kind tattoos by spending the right amount of time nailing down the design first with the customer, and then drawing the design to best fit the contours of the body.</p>

						<h1>Robby Latos</h1>
						<h2>Tattoo Artist</h2>
						<a href="/main/work">Continue</a>
					</header>
					<p>Latos has a formal art education that gave him a strong lead in his tattoo apprenticeship. Since then, Latos has attracted a lot of outside attention for his talents in tattooing. His realism and his ability to make fantastical concepts appear all but impossible make us all scratch our heads in wonder.</p>
